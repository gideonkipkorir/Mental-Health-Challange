# Mental-Health-Challange_NLP
The data consists of statements and questions expressed by students from multiple universities across Kenya who reported suffering from these different mental health challenges.  The wording of the statements is intended to respond to the prompting question, “What is on your mind?”  Note that the written statements may include some spelling or grammatical errors, as well as slang. Also note that labels were not assigned to the statements, but rather students provided statements and questions about their particular experience.  The labels for the training set are contained in Train.csv, corresponding to one of the four categories of mental health problems (depression, suicide, alchoholism, and drug abuse). Your task is to develop a machine learning model to predict the labels for the test set, following the format in sample_submission.csv.
